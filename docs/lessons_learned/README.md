# Lessons Learned

Distilled rules from past code reviews and bugs. **Every Claude Code session must read this folder at startup** — see `CLAUDE.md` for the mandate.

Each lesson follows the same shape:

- **What went wrong** — the specific mistake, with file/line where useful.
- **Pattern** — the rule going forward, with code snippets where mechanical.
- **Detection checklist** — what to grep / look for to catch the same mistake again.
- **Reference** — Google doc URL and the originating PR.

## Adding a new lesson

When a PR review surfaces a new pattern worth preserving:

1. Number the file as the next sequential ID (zero-padded to 3 digits).
2. Use a kebab-case slug derived from the rule.
3. Add an entry to the index above.
4. Commit the lesson alongside the fix it documents.

A lesson is only worth writing down if it had prevented the original mistake — abstract advice doesn't qualify. Be specific. Cite file paths, grep patterns, and the exact Google doc URL.
