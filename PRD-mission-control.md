# PRD-mission-control.md — OpenRang Architecture & Component Specs

**Status:** Living document — update as the system evolves.
**Owner:** Steven Gates
**Last updated from build session:** 2026-05-27

## 1. Executive Summary

OpenRang is an open-source Android camera app for creating custom, speed-controlled video loops. The system captures 1.5-second video bursts, generates seamless forward-backward loops via Media3 Transformer, and gives users real-time speed control (0.5x–3.0x) before exporting. All processing is 100% on-device.

The architecture follows MVVM with Jetpack Compose, a sealed-interface state machine, and a local file-based storage pipeline for videos and thumbnails. The app is designed to be device-agnostic (CameraX) and privacy-first (zero network requirements).

### Current build state

Phases 1–2 are complete (camera viewfinder, burst capture, gallery, onboarding). Phases 3–5 (loop generation, speed slider, export) are next. This PRD is the authoritative reference for all structural decisions.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

- Seamless 1.5-second video burst capture with automatic stop
- Forward-backward loop generation entirely on-device using Media3 Transformer
- Real-time speed adjustment (0.5x–3.0x) with instant preview feedback
- Export with speed burn-in to device gallery for sharing
- Persistent local gallery with thumbnail caching for performant browsing
- Beautiful, polished UI matching the glassmorphic vaporwave aesthetic
- 100% unit test coverage for ViewModel logic; UI regression tests for layout-critical composables

### Non-Goals (this build window)

- Cloud storage or sync — all data stays on-device
- Social features (sharing to specific platforms, comments, likes)
- Audio recording toggle UI — audio is captured if permission exists, no toggle yet
- Custom capture duration — fixed at 1.5s for now
- Filters or visual effects — raw capture only
- Tablet or foldable-specific layouts

```

### State Machine

All navigation is driven by a single `MutableStateFlow<OpenRangUiState>` in `OpenRangViewModel`. States:

| State | Description | Transitions to |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `Onboarding` | 3-page carousel (first launch) | `CheckingPermissions` |
| `CheckingPermissions` | Runtime permission check | `ReadyToCapture` or `PermissionDenied` |
| `PermissionDenied` | Permission dialog with settings link | `CheckingPermissions` (retry) |
| `ReadyToCapture` | Live camera viewfinder | `Recording`, `Gallery` |
| `Recording` | Active 1.5s burst capture | `LoopingPreview` (success) or `ReadyToCapture` (failure) |
| `Processing` | (Planned) Loop generation in progress | `LoopingPreview` |
| `LoopingPreview` | ExoPlayer infinite loop preview | `ReadyToCapture` |
| `Gallery` | Recorded bursts grid | `ReadyToCapture` |

### Design System Tokens

| Token | Hex | Alpha | Role |
|-------|-----|-------|------|
| `NeonCoral` | `#FF5252` | 100% | Primary accent |
| `NeonPurple` | `#7C4DFF` | 100% | Secondary accent |
| `GlassWhite` | `#FFFFFF` | 20% | Glassmorphic fill |
| `GlassWhiteBorder` | `#FFFFFF` | 30% | Glassmorphic border |
| `DeepCharcoal` | `#1A1A1D` | 80% | Overlay bars |

Gradients: `NeonCoral → NeonPurple` horizontal for primary actions. Theme: `darkColorScheme` only.

## 4. Component Specifications

### 4.1 CameraManager.kt

**Purpose:** Manages CameraX lifecycle — preview binding, video recording, lens toggling.

| Method | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `startCamera(lifecycleOwner, previewView)` | Binds Preview + VideoCapture use cases at HD quality |
| `toggleCamera(lifecycleOwner, previewView)` | Switches between `LENS_FACING_BACK` and `LENS_FACING_FRONT`, rebinds |
| `startRecording(outputFile, callback)` | Records to file with audio (if permitted), fires `VideoRecordEvent` callbacks |
| `stopRecording()` | Stops active recording |
| `shutdown()` | Releases executor resources |

### 4.2 OpenRangViewModel.kt

**Purpose:** MVVM hub. Owns UI state, recording lifecycle, video storage pipeline, gallery operations.

**State:** `MutableStateFlow<OpenRangUiState>` exposed as `StateFlow`.

**Video storage:**
- On successful capture: copies `raw_capture.mp4` from `cacheDir` to `filesDir/videos/clip_<timestamp>.mp4`
- Extracts thumbnail at 0ms via `MediaMetadataRetriever` → `filesDir/thumbnails/clip_<timestamp>.jpg` (JPEG, 90% quality)
- Fallback: on-demand thumbnail extraction during `loadRecordedVideos()` if cache miss

**Key flows:**

| Flow | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| `startBurstCapture` | Shutter tap (state must be `ReadyToCapture`) | Sets `Recording`, starts CameraManager, launches 1500ms auto-stop coroutine |
| `stopBurstCapture` | Auto-timer or manual | Cancels coroutine job, stops CameraManager |
| `saveFinalizedVideo` | `VideoRecordEvent.Finalize` success | Copies to persistent storage, extracts thumbnail, returns destination `File` |
| `loadRecordedVideos` | Gallery entry | Scans `filesDir/videos/clip_*.mp4`, maps to `RecordedVideo` list (newest first) |
| `deleteVideo` | Gallery delete tap | Removes `.mp4` + `.jpg`, reloads list |
| `navigateToGallery` | Home button tap | Sets `Gallery` state, loads videos |
| `navigateBackFromGallery` | Gallery back button | Sets `ReadyToCapture` |

**Data class:**
```kotlin
data class RecordedVideo(
    val id: Long,           // timestamp parsed from filename
    val videoPath: String,  // absolute path to .mp4
    val thumbnailPath: String // absolute path to .jpg
)
```

### 4.3 CameraScreen.kt

**Purpose:** Live camera viewfinder with recording controls.

**Layout (top to bottom):**
1. Full-screen CameraX `PreviewView` (AndroidView, `FILL_CENTER`)
2. Top gradient bar: home button (top-left, neon gradient, 44dp) + recording indicator
3. Bottom gradient bar: 1.5s badge (glass, 54dp) | shutter button (86dp, dual-ring glow) | flip camera (glass, 54dp)

**Interactions:**
- Shutter: `viewModel.startBurstCapture()` (disabled while recording)
- Home: `viewModel.navigateToGallery(context)`
- Flip: `cameraManager.toggleCamera()`

### 4.4 OnboardingScreen.kt

**Purpose:** 3-page horizontal carousel introducing the app.

**Architecture:**
- Page data modeled as `OnboardingPage(title, drawableRes, glowColor)` data class with a list of 3 instances
- Navigation extracted into `OnboardingNavigation` (internal composable) — **MUST remain extracted to avoid ColumnScope.AnimatedVisibility bug** (see decision log)
- Dot indicators use `animateFloatAsState` for smooth size transitions
- Navigation buttons use `AnimatedVisibility` with `fadeIn + scaleIn` / `fadeOut + scaleOut`

**Private color palette:** `DeepIndigo`, `DarkPlum`, `VoidBlack`, `FrostedGlass`, `FrostedGlassBorder`

**Pages:**
1. "No Subscriptions & No Ads" — skater visual, coral glow
2. "Built by Everyone, For Everyone" — bubbles visual, purple glow
3. "Just Point, Tap & Loop!" — confetti visual, cyan glow

### 4.5 PreviewScreen.kt

**Purpose:** Full-screen looping video playback after capture.

- ExoPlayer with `REPEAT_MODE_ALL`, no player controls visible
- Top banner: "OPENRANG" title + "RAW BURST PREVIEW (1.5S)" subtitle
- Bottom: "RETAKE BURST" button → `viewModel.resetToCapture()`
- (Planned) Speed slider integration in Phase 4

### 4.6 GalleryScreen.kt

**Purpose:** Grid display of all recorded bursts with playback and deletion.

**Layout:**
- Header: back button (64dp, glass + NeonPurple border, ArrowLeftIcon) + "YOUR BURSTS" title
- Empty state: "NO BURSTS YET" message
- Grid: `LazyVerticalGrid(GridCells.Fixed(3))`, 9:16 aspect ratio cards
- Cards: `BitmapFactory.decodeFile` thumbnail, press-scale animation (0.93x), delete button (coral circle, top-right)
- Playback overlay: full-screen `Dialog` with ExoPlayer loop + "CLOSE PREVIEW" gradient capsule button

### 4.7 MainActivity.kt

**Purpose:** Entry point. Handles permissions, state-based routing, theme.

- Permission launcher: `CAMERA` + `RECORD_AUDIO` via `ActivityResultContracts.RequestMultiplePermissions`
- Routing: `when (uiState)` dispatches to the appropriate screen composable
- Theme: `OpenRangTheme` wrapping `darkColorScheme(primary = NeonCoral, secondary = NeonPurple, background = #121212)`
- Includes `CheckingPermissionsScreen` and `PermissionDeniedScreen` inline composables

---

## 5. Planned Components (Phases 3–5)

### 5.1 VideoProcessor.kt (Phase 3)

**Purpose:** Media3 Transformer pipeline for loop generation.

**Pipeline:**
1. Input: `raw_capture.mp4` (1.5s forward clip)
2. Reversal: Transformer with reversed frame timestamps → `reversed_capture.mp4`
3. Concatenation: `Composition` / `EditedMediaItem` joining forward + reversed → `openrang_output.mp4`
4. Output: seamless loop file ready for preview

**Constraints:**
- Processing must complete in <1 second on mid-range devices
- `Processing` UI state shown during transform
- Error handling falls back to `ReadyToCapture` with a log

### 5.2 Speed Slider (Phase 4)

**Integration point:** `PreviewScreen.kt`

- Compose `Slider` range: 0.5f to 3.0f, default 1.5f
- Connected to `ExoPlayer.setPlaybackSpeed()`
- Speed value stored in `LoopingPreview` state for export

### 5.3 Export Pipeline (Phase 5)

**Purpose:** Burn selected speed into final video and save to device gallery.

- Transformer with `SpeedChangingVideoEffect` + `SpeedChangingAudioProcessor`
- Output to `MediaStore.Video.Media` (public gallery)
- Filename: `OpenRang_Capture_<timestamp>.mp4`
- Completion toast, return to viewfinder

## 6. Data Layer

### File Structure

```
context.filesDir/
├── videos/
│   ├── clip_1716825600000.mp4
│   ├── clip_1716825660000.mp4
│   └── ...
└── thumbnails/
    ├── clip_1716825600000.jpg
    ├── clip_1716825660000.jpg
    └── ...

context.cacheDir/
└── raw_capture.mp4              # temporary, overwritten each capture
```

### Schemas

**RecordedVideo (in-memory):**
```kotlin
data class RecordedVideo(
    val id: Long,              // e.g. 1716825600000 (epoch millis from filename)
    val videoPath: String,     // e.g. "/data/.../files/videos/clip_1716825600000.mp4"
    val thumbnailPath: String  // e.g. "/data/.../files/thumbnails/clip_1716825600000.jpg"
)
```

**Naming convention:** `clip_<System.currentTimeMillis()>.mp4` / `.jpg`

### Refresh Strategy

| File | Populated by | Trigger | Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `videos/clip_*.mp4` | `saveFinalizedVideo()` | Successful capture finalize | Create new file (never overwrite) |
| `thumbnails/clip_*.jpg` | `saveFinalizedVideo()` or `loadRecordedVideos()` | Save-time extraction or on-demand fallback | Create if missing |
| `cacheDir/raw_capture.mp4` | `startBurstCapture()` | Each new capture | Overwrite previous |

---

## 7. Testing Architecture

### Unit Tests (app/src/test/)

| Test | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| `initial state is Onboarding` | Default state |
| `onOnboardingCompleted transitions to CheckingPermissions` | Onboarding → permissions flow |
| `onPermissionsChecked when granted/denied` | Permission branching |
| `resetToCapture transitions state` | State reset |
| `startBurstCapture when not ready` | Guard clause |
| `startBurstCapture starts recording and delays stop` | Full capture lifecycle with time advance |
| `startBurstCapture failures fallback` | Error recovery |
| `stopBurstCapture cancels job` | Clean shutdown |
| `Finalize → LoopingPreview on success` | Happy path |
| `Finalize → ReadyToCapture on error` | Error path |
| `navigateToGallery transitions to Gallery` | Navigation |
| `navigateBackFromGallery transitions to ReadyToCapture` | Navigation |
| `loadRecordedVideos with missing directory` | Empty state |
| `deleteVideo removes files and reloads` | Deletion flow |
| `recordedVideos flow starts empty` | Initial state |

### UI Tests (app/src/androidTest/)

| Test | What it guards |
|------|---------------|
| `page0_nextButton_isDisplayedAndCentered` | Button centering regression |
| `page1_backAndNextButtons_areDisplayedAndCentered` | Button centering regression |
| `page2_ctaButton_isDisplayedAndFillsWidth` | CTA layout regression |
| `page0_doesNotShowPage1OrPage2Controls` | Mutual exclusivity |
| `page1_doesNotShowPage0OrPage2Controls` | Mutual exclusivity |
| `page2_doesNotShowPage0OrPage1Controls` | Mutual exclusivity |

---

## 8. Decision Log

| # | Decision | Reasoning | Trade-off |
|---|----------|-----------|-----------||
| 1 | **Sealed interface for UI state** | Exhaustive `when` matching at compile time prevents missing state handling | Slightly more boilerplate than enum, but safer with data-carrying states like `LoopingPreview` |
| 2 | **Single ViewModel, no nav library** | App has <10 screens, all state-driven; Compose Navigation adds complexity without value at this scale | Will need migration if screen count grows significantly |
| 3 | **`filesDir` for video storage, not `cacheDir`** | Gallery videos are user-created content that must persist across sessions | Uses more permanent storage; need manual cleanup via delete |
| 4 | **Eager + lazy thumbnail extraction** | Eager at save time for speed; lazy fallback for resilience if thumbnail is somehow lost | Slightly more code than eager-only, but prevents blank grid cards |
| 5 | **OnboardingNavigation extracted as internal composable** | ColumnScope.AnimatedVisibility resolves to slide animations that cause layout jumping; extraction breaks the scope chain | Function is `internal` (not `private`) to enable UI regression testing |
| 6 | **OnboardingPage data class model** | Eliminates 3 separate `when` branches for title/drawable/glow; adding pages is a one-line change | Minor: data class is private to file, not reusable outside onboarding |
| 7 | **animateFloatAsState for dot indicators** | Smooth size interpolation instead of snap; uses float → `.dp` conversion to avoid `animateDpAsState` import ambiguity | Negligible performance cost |
| 8 | **BitmapFactory.decodeFile for thumbnails** | No image-loading library dependency (Coil/Glide); thumbnails are small local JPEGs | Will need Coil if we ever load remote images or need cache management |
| 9 | **Home button gets neon gradient, flip camera gets glass** | Home/gallery is a primary navigation action; flip camera is secondary utility. Visual weight should match importance | Flip camera is less discoverable in glass style |
| 10 | **Dark-only theme** | Matches vaporwave aesthetic; camera apps benefit from dark UI (less screen glare on subjects) | No light mode for accessibility preferences |
| 11 | **No onboarding persistence (intentional)** | Early-stage; onboarding shows every launch. Will add SharedPreferences/DataStore flag when the onboarding is finalized | Returning users see onboarding each time — acceptable during development |
| 12 | **No skip button on onboarding (intentional)** | 3 pages is short enough; forced traversal ensures users see all value props | Mild friction for power users; revisit post-launch |

## 9. Build Plan — Remaining Phases

### Phase 3: Loop Generation (~3 hours)

| Block | What gets built | Who | Output | Done when |
|-------|----------------|-----|--------|-----------||
| 3.1 | Create `VideoProcessor.kt` with Transformer reversal pipeline | Cowork | `reversed_capture.mp4` generated from any input | Reversed file plays backward correctly |
| 3.2 | Add concatenation (forward + reversed) | Cowork | `openrang_output.mp4` = seamless loop | Loop plays without stutter or black flash at inflection |
| 3.3 | Wire into ViewModel: `Recording` → `Processing` → `LoopingPreview` | Cowork | State transitions work end-to-end | Capture → loop preview in one tap |
| 3.4 | Unit tests for VideoProcessor + updated ViewModel tests | Cowork | Tests pass | Processing state, error handling, output file assertions |

### Phase 4: Speed Slider (~2 hours)

| Block | What gets built | Who | Output | Done when |
|-------|----------------|-----|--------|-----------||
| 4.1 | Add Compose Slider to PreviewScreen (0.5x–3.0x, default 1.5x) | Cowork | Slider visible on preview | Slider renders, value changes |
| 4.2 | Connect slider to ExoPlayer.setPlaybackSpeed() | Cowork | Real-time speed changes | Dragging slider instantly changes playback speed |
| 4.3 | Persist speed in LoopingPreview state for export handoff | Cowork | Speed value available downstream | Speed survives state reads |

### Phase 5: Export (~2 hours)

| Block | What gets built | Who | Output | Done when |
|-------|----------------|-----|--------|-----------||
| 5.1 | Transformer speed burn-in pipeline | Cowork | Final video at selected speed | Exported file plays at burned-in speed in any player |
| 5.2 | Save to MediaStore + completion UI | Cowork | File in device gallery + toast | Video appears in Photos/Gallery app |
| 5.3 | Return-to-viewfinder flow | Cowork | Clean state reset | App returns to ReadyToCapture after save |

### Cut order (if behind)

1. Drop Phase 5.2 toast polish — save still works, just no confirmation UI
2. Drop Phase 4 slider — hardcode speed at 1.5x, add slider later
3. **Never cut:** Phase 3 (loop generation is the core feature)

---

## 10. Out of Scope / Future Work

| Feature | Why deferred | Effort |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Audio toggle UI | Capture works with audio if permission granted; toggle is UX polish | Small |
| Custom capture duration | 1.5s is the MVP constraint; slider adds complexity | Medium |
| Filters/effects (color grading, vignette) | Requires shader pipeline; not core to loop concept | Large |
| Share-to-platform flow | Export to gallery is sufficient; direct share is distribution polish | Medium |
| Onboarding persistence (DataStore) | Intentionally deferred; onboarding not finalized | Small |
| Light mode / dynamic theming | Dark-only matches aesthetic; accessibility concern for later | Medium |
| Tablet/foldable layouts | minSdk 26 covers phones; adaptive layouts are a separate initiative | Large |

**Scaling model:** New features follow the existing pattern — add a state to the sealed interface, add a screen composable, route in MainActivity. The architecture scales without restructuring up to ~10–12 screens before a nav library becomes worthwhile.
