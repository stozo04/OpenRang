# OpenLoop

**The open-source Boomerang camera app that should have existed years ago.**

No subscriptions. No ads. No data harvesting. Just point, tap, and loop.

OpenLoop is a free Android camera app for creating speed-controlled video loops — the kind of thing Big Tech locks behind paywalls and cluttered UIs. We're leveraging the power of AI and open-source tooling to bring the coolest creative toys to everyone, for free, forever.

Built with Google's latest Android libraries. Runs entirely on your device. Your videos never leave your phone.

## What It Does

- **Burst Capture** — Tap the shutter for a quick 1.5-second video burst (custom duration coming soon)
- **Seamless Loops** — Forward-backward loop generation entirely on-device via Media3 Transformer
- **Speed Control** — Real-time playback speed slider from 0.5x to 3.0x before you save
- **Gallery** — Browse, replay, and manage all your loops in a slick grid
- **100% Private** — Zero network calls. Zero tracking. Everything stays on your phone

## Why OpenLoop?

Every boomerang/loop app on the Play Store either costs money, runs ads, or sends your videos to a server you don't control. OpenLoop is the alternative:

- **Open source** (Apache 2.0) — read every line, fork it, improve it
- **No accounts** — no sign-up, no login, no profile
- **No ads, ever** — not now, not later, not with a "premium tier"
- **AI-assisted development** — built faster and better by pairing human creativity with AI tooling
- **Google-first architecture** — follows every Jetpack best practice Google recommends

## Architecture & Tech Stack

| Layer           | Technology                        | What It Does                                                                        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Language**    | Kotlin                            | Modern, concise, Google's preferred language for Android                            |
| **UI**          | Jetpack Compose                   | Declarative UI — no XML layouts, no fragments                                       |
| **Camera**      | AndroidX CameraX                  | Device-agnostic camera API that works across 1000+ Android devices                  |
| **Media**       | AndroidX Media3                   | ExoPlayer for looping playback, Transformer for video reversal & export             |
| **Preferences** | Jetpack DataStore                 | Async, coroutine-based key-value storage (replaces SharedPreferences)               |
| **State**       | MVVM + StateFlow                  | Single ViewModel, sealed-interface state machine, unidirectional data flow          |
| **Testing**     | JUnit 4 + MockK + Compose UI Test | Unit tests for ViewModel logic, UI regression tests for layout-critical composables |

**SDK levels:** `minSdk 26` (Android 8.0) · `compileSdk 36` · `targetSdk 36` — upgraded to **API 36 (Android 16)** for Google Play readiness (`minSdk` stays 26), tracked in [Issue #7](https://github.com/stozo04/OpenLoop/issues/7), with the full behavior-change breakdown in [`docs/android-16/`](docs/android-16/README.md). Google Play's target-API rule: [Target API Level Requirements](https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk).

### State Machine

```
Initializing → Onboarding → CheckingPermissions → ReadyToCapture <-> Recording
           \                       |                      |
        CheckingPermissions     Gallery            LoopingPreview
         (returning user)          |
                            ReadyToCapture
```

All navigation is driven by a single `MutableStateFlow<OpenLoopUiState>` — no Jetpack Navigation needed at this scale. The `Initializing` state reads from DataStore to determine whether to show onboarding or skip straight to the camera.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone it:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stozo04/OpenLoop.git
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio** (Hedgehog or newer recommended)

3. **Sync Gradle and run** the `:app` module on a device or emulator running Android 8.0+ (API 26+)

That's it. No API keys, no backend, no environment variables.

### Building from the command line (no Android Studio UI)

Sometimes you just want to build from a terminal — to check it compiles or to produce an installable APK. The project ships with the **Gradle wrapper** (`gradlew`), so you don't need to install Gradle yourself.

**1. Point Java at a JDK.** Gradle needs a Java Development Kit to run. The easiest one to use is the JDK bundled *inside* Android Studio (the "JBR"). Tell your terminal where it lives:

- **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  $env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr"
  ```
- **macOS:**
  ```bash
  export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
  ```

(If `java -version` already prints a version in your terminal, Java is set up, and you can skip this step.)

**2. Build the app.** Use `.\gradlew.bat` on Windows, or `./gradlew` on macOS/Linux:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

The finished app lands at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

**Other handy commands** (drop them in place of `assembleDebug`):

| Command                     | What it does                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `clean`                     | Deletes old build output — run it first if a build is acting weird           |
| `assembleDebug`             | Builds the normal debug APK (everyday "does it compile and run?")            |
| `assembleRelease`           | Builds the optimized, shrunk release APK (the kind that goes to Google Play) |
| `testDebugUnitTest`         | Runs the fast unit tests — no phone needed                                   |
| `connectedDebugAndroidTest` | Runs the UI tests — needs a connected device or emulator                     |

You can chain them, e.g. `.\gradlew.bat clean assembleDebug`.

**How do I know it actually worked?** Don't trust "the command finished" — trust two signals:

1. The last line says **`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`** (a failure says `BUILD FAILED` and explains why).
2. The **exit code is `0`**. Check it right after the build — PowerShell: `echo $LASTEXITCODE`; macOS/Linux: `echo $?`. `0` means success; anything else means it failed.

Then skim the output for lines starting with `e:` (errors — these stop the build) or `w:` (warnings — these don't, but are worth a glance). A genuinely clean build prints `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` with no `e:` lines.

> **Gotcha:** if you pipe the build through something like `... | tail`, the exit code you see belongs to `tail`, not Gradle — so a failed build can look like it "passed." Check the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`/`BUILD FAILED` line itself, not just whether the command returned cleanly.

### Running the code inspections (Android Studio "Inspect Code", from a terminal)

OpenLoop reproduces Android Studio's **Analyze → Inspect Code** as a merge gate. It's **two
engines** — full design and severity rules in [`docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md`](docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md).
Set `JAVA_HOME` first (same as the build section above).

**Engine 1 — Android Lint** (fast, automated, the hard gate):

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:lintDebug
```

Report lands at `app/build/reports/lint-results-debug.xml` (+ `.html`). A committed
`lint-baseline.xml` filters out the project's pre-existing items, so a clean run reports **only
issues your branch introduced** — the XML will contain just the informational `LintBaseline`
"Hint" line. The [`pr-reviewer`](.claude/skills/pr-reviewer/SKILL.md) skill runs this automatically
and folds the findings into its PR comment.

> Regenerating the baseline (`app/lint-baseline.xml`) silently swallows *all* current issues,
> including newly-introduced ones — only do it deliberately. See `docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md`.

**Engine 2 — IDE inspections + proofreading** (faithful Kotlin/Markdown/grammar pass; slow, local):

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\bin\inspect.bat" `
  "C:\Users\gates\Personal\OpenLoop" `
  ".idea\inspectionProfiles\Project_Default.xml" `
  "build\inspection-results" `
  -v2 -d "C:\Users\gates\Personal\OpenLoop"
```

This boots a headless Android Studio (takes minutes) and writes one XML per inspection into
`build\inspection-results`. **Close the project in Android Studio first** and don't run a Gradle
task at the same time — they deadlock on the Gradle build lock.

**Tier 3 — OSS fallback** (for CI / machines without Android Studio): fast Node-based
approximations of Engine 2's Markdown/typo/link checks, scoped to a PR's changed Markdown. Needs
Node (no `npm install` — `npx` fetches on demand). Advisory only; configs live at the repo root
(`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, `cspell.json`, `.markdown-link-check.json`).

```bash
FILES=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d main...HEAD -- '*.md')
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 $FILES                                  # tables, list numbering, structure
npx --yes cspell --no-progress $FILES                               # typos (project dictionary in cspell.json)
for f in $FILES; do npx --yes markdown-link-check --config .markdown-link-check.json "$f"; done  # broken links
```

(detekt for Kotlin is deferred — stable detekt doesn't support Kotlin 2.3.x yet; see
[`docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md`](docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md).)

## Guides

Plain-English, beginner-friendly walkthroughs live in [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/):

- [**Jetpack DataStore — Explained Like You're Five**](docs/guides/jetpack-datastore-explained.md) — what the app's little "memory" is, where it lives on the phone, three ways to peek inside it, and how to reset onboarding for testing.

## Development Standards

This project follows Google's official Android development guidance. See [`docs/ANDROID_STANDARDS.md`](docs/ANDROID_STANDARDS.md) for the full standards reference with links to Google's specs. We treat these as non-negotiable — if Google recommends it, we follow it. For Android 16 / `targetSdk 36`-specific guidance behind the in-progress upgrade, see the [`docs/android-16/`](docs/android-16/README.md) knowledge hub.

### PR Merge Policy

**No PR merges without passing the automated standards review.**

Every pull request is reviewed by an autonomous compliance agent ([`.claude/skills/pr-reviewer/`](.claude/skills/pr-reviewer/)) that audits code changes against 11 categories and 75+ checklist items sourced from Google's official Android documentation:

Architecture, DataStore, Permissions, Compose, CameraX, Media & Audio, Coroutines, Testing, Accessibility, Play Store Readiness, and Android Version Compatibility.

The reviewer web-searches `developer.android.com` for the latest guidance on every run — no stale rules. It posts a structured PASS/FAIL/WARNING report directly on the PR with file-level specifics, Google doc citations, and reasoning for every finding.

On top of the standards review, every PR must also pass **code inspection** — the same checks
Android Studio's *Analyze → Inspect Code* produces, run headlessly. There are two engines (see
[`docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md`](docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md) for the full design and the exact commands):

- **Engine 1 — Android Lint** (`./gradlew :app:lintDebug`): automated, run by the reviewer skill,
  a hard gate — **zero new lint errors** to merge. A committed `lint-baseline.xml` means only
  issues *introduced by the PR* are reported, not the project's pre-existing items.
- **Engine 2 — IDE inspections + proofreading** (`inspect.bat`): the faithful Kotlin-redundancy /
  Markdown / grammar-and-typo pass. Run **locally before merge** (it needs Android Studio and is
  slow); the reviewer notes whether it was run.

**To merge, a PR must:**
1. Receive an **APPROVE** verdict from the standards reviewer (zero FAILs)
2. Address all **WARNINGS** or document why they're accepted
3. Pass all unit tests (19+) and UI regression tests (6+)
4. Show **zero new Android Lint errors** (Engine 1), and have **IDE Code Inspection** (Engine 2)
   run locally with its findings addressed or accepted

### Fixing Review Feedback

When a PR gets review feedback, open a new Cowork session with the OpenLoop folder mounted and say:

> Start addressing PR feedback following `docs/prompts/PR-FEEDBACK-RESOLUTION.md` — here is the PR: https://github.com/stozo04/OpenLoop/pull/XX

Replace `XX` with your PR number. The agent will read the review comments, web-search Google's latest standards to verify each finding, fix the code, push, post a response comment explaining what was fixed and why, then run a fresh review to confirm zero FAILs.
