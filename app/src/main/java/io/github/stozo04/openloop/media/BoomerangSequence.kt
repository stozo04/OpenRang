/**
 * Resolve the ordered clip sequence for [mode] repeated [repetitions] times, deciding the 1-frame
 * seam drop by **sequence position** rather than clip identity.
 *
 * Why position, not identity: a boomerang concatenates clips, and wherever a clip plays in the
 * *opposite* temporal direction to the clip before it (forward↔reversed), the two share a boundary
 * frame — the first clip's last rendered frame is pixel-identical to the second clip's first. Played
 * back, that duplicate reads as a freeze/stutter at the seam, so the trailing clip drops its leading
 * frame (parent IMPLEMENTATION.md §6.4).
 *
 * The rule:
 *  - The first clip never drops (nothing precedes it).
 *  - A clip drops its leading frame iff its [ClipDirection] differs from the preceding clip's.
 *
 * This keeps the drop correct for every mode AND every repetition count, fixing two latent slice-02
 * bugs that only surface once direction is user-selectable and clips can be reordered/repeated:
 *  - `FORWARD` / `REVERSE` (and any repeats): all clips face the same way, so no boundary is a turn
 *    and nothing is dropped — in particular a lone `REVERSE` clip no longer loses a real frame (the
 *    old code always dropped "the reversed clip" regardless of where it sat).
 *  - `FORWARD_THEN_REVERSE` / `REVERSE_THEN_FORWARD`: every internal boundary is a direction turn —
 *    both the within-cycle seam (e.g. F→R) and the cycle-to-cycle seam (e.g. R→F when repeated) — so
 *    every clip after the first drops. The old code dropped only the reversed clip, leaving the
 *    `REVERSE_THEN_FORWARD` seam (head of the forward clip) un-dropped and dropping the wrong clip.

 * is `cycle × repetitions`, then divided by [speed] because faster playback yields a shorter clip.
